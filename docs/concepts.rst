Concepts
============================

Suitcase is a generic packaging system, the following outlines the concepts and features that are key to it's operation.

Packages
---------------------
Packages are individual packages that are generated by suitcase.

Package Collections
-------------------------
Package Collections provide a way to make collective decisions about how to turn a group of directories into packages with common configuration.

Presently this assumes that the collection is all subdirectories of a specific path. Perhaps later this can be extended to allow collections to be spread over the filesystem

Destination Mapping
---------------------
Makes it possible to define arbitrary mappings of where files in your branch should end up when the package is deployed on the target system. This makes it possible to have you branch defined in the way that suits your development without being directly tied to a layout that is required for packages to be built.

Hooks
------------------

Hooks make it possible to change the configuration and process the files before creating a package. This makes it possible to do anything you need to do as part of your packaging build process.

Frequently Asked Questions FAQ
=================================


Why default to .deb files?
    Debian packaging works really well for debian and Ubuntu machines and it solves the dependency issues in a cool way. At a later stage there's no reason why you couldn't use a-n-other packaging solution for the end result though we're not currently planning to ship one by default

Why Suitcase?
    Because suitcases are for packing!

How do I contribute?
    We are definitely looking for new packaging classes for things like rpm, yum, setuptools etc. If you are interested in contributing please check-out the public branch and let us know if you hit any issues with integrating new packaging systems.
